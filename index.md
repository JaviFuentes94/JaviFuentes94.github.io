Hey! I am Javier ðŸ‘‹

I work with applied machine learning. Nowadays I work at [Uizard](https://uizard.io), where we are building the world's first machine learning powered design tool.   

In my previous life I was working with robotics at both [ETH](https://asl.ethz.ch/) and [DTU](https://www.dtu.dk/english), mostly on projects related to intelligent robotics and robot vision. 

Remember to [Follow me on Twitter]() to learn more about some of my [projects](projects) and in general the world of building machine learning powered products.
