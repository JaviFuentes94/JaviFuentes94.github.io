Hey! My name is Javier and I work with applied machine learning. Nowadays I work at [Uizard](https://uizard.io), where I am applying machine learning to different problems in the design field.  Previously I have been working with robotics at both [ETH](https://asl.ethz.ch/) and [DTU](https://www.dtu.dk/english), mostly on projects related to intelligent robotics and robot vision. 

### Cool projects I have worked on
 - Uizard
 - Robotics
