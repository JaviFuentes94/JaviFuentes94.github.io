Hey! I am Javier ðŸ‘‹

I design and implement machine learning solutions for real world problems. I love reading papers for inspiration and then complaining about the lack of data to bringing them to products.

Currently, I am working on different CV & NLP problems at [Uizard](https://uizard.io), where we are building the world's first machine learning powered design tool. We believe that you can design products if machine learning gives you a hand.    

Sometimes I also build stuff on the side, you can check my [projects page](projects).

In my previous life, I was working with robotics at both [ETH](https://asl.ethz.ch/) and [DTU](https://www.dtu.dk/english), mostly on projects related to intelligent robotics and robot vision. 

When I am not reading papers or learning about some new cool tech stuff you will find me cooking, hiking, taking pictures, or (when the pandemics allow for it) doing all of the previous ones in different places around the world.   

Feel free to reach out through [email](javierfuentesalonso@gmail.com) or any of my social media profiles. And remember to [Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/JavierFnts) to check what I am up to.
