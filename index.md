Hey! I am Javier ðŸ‘‹

I design and implement machine learning solutions for real world problems. I love reading papers for inspiration and then complaining about the lack of necessary data to bringing them to products.

Currently I am working on different CV & NLP problems at [Uizard](https://uizard.io), where we are building the world's first machine learning powered design tool. We believe that you can design products if machine learning gives you a hand.    

Sometimes I also build stuff on the side, check out the [projects page](projects).

In my previous life I was working with robotics at both [ETH](https://asl.ethz.ch/) and [DTU](https://www.dtu.dk/english), mostly on projects related to intelligent robotics and robot vision. 

When I am not reading papers or learning about the coolest new tech stuff you will find me cooking, hiking, taking pictures or (when the pandemics allows for it) doing all of the previous ones in different places around the world.   

This passion for travelling, as well as my studies and my work have taken me to quite a few places around the world, but in case my name didn't show it to you I am originally from Burgos, Spain. 

Feel free to reach out through [email](javierfuentesalonso@gmail.com) or any of my social media profiles. And remember to [Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/JavierFnts) to check what I am up to.
